Once the tournament is over, and the leaderboard is set and complete, the last step is to let the user redeem and withdraw their winnings.

## Delivering the vouchers

The game studio needs to deliver the vouchers to the winning players. This can be done in whatever way the studio sees fit. For example, it might be shown as an in-game notification or modal, or be sent to the user's email address.

## Redeeming the vouchers

The winners will then click their voucher link, redeem it on `https://wallet.gloot.com/redeemvoucher?voucher_id={the-voucher-id}` and proceed with the instructions to withdraw their money.
