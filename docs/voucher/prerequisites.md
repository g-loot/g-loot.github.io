To be able to use this service, your game must meet the following conditions:

### - Skilled based

The skill of the participants must determine the outcome of a match. This is required to avoid being categorized as gambling under local regulations. The G-Loot compliance team will investigate each game on a case-by-case basis and evaluate if the game can be considered to be skill-based. Some RNG, such as bullet spread in FPS-games, may be allowed provided that those mechanics do not, to any significant extent, affect the prevalence of skill in the match outcome.

### - Produce a leaderboard

The game must produce a list of tournament participants, sorted by some metric, to whom the prizes should be distributed. How this list is produced is within the creative freedom of the game studio to decide. To ensure the tournament results could be verified in case of an audit, each user in the results list must be identified by their unique in-game ID.

### - Present the T&C

The tournament is legally hosted by G-Loot. Therefore, the user must accept the G-Loot terms and conditions before entering any tournament or competition in which G-Loot will handle the prize distribution.
