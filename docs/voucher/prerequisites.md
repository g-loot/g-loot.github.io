In order to be able to use this service, your game must meet the following conditions:

### - Skilled based

The outcome of a match that is eligible for prizes must be determined by the skill of the participants. This is required to avoid getting categorized as gambling by local regulations. The G-Loot compliance team will investigate each game on a case-by-case basis and evaluate if the game can be considered to be skill-based. Some RNG, such as for example bullet spread in FPS-games, may be allowed provided that those mechanics does not to any large extent affect the prevalence of skill in the match outcome.

### - Produce a leaderboard

The game needs to produce a list of the participants of the tournament, sorted by some metric for which the prizes should be distributed. How this list is produced is within the creative freedom of the game studio to decide. The list must identify each user by their in-game unique id, to ensure that the results of the tournament could be verified in case of an audit.

### - Present the T&C

Since the tournament is legally hosted by G-Loot, the user needs to be presented with the G-Loot terms and conditions before entering any tournament or competition in which the prize distribution should be handled by G-Loot.
