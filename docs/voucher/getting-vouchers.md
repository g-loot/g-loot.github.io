The first step is to acquire vouchers. This is a manual process where the game studio and the G-Loot compliance team first make sure that the game mechanics, tournament structure, and prize distribution scheme are legal within the realms of competitive gaming. Once a prize distribution scheme has been agreed upon, the game studio will be sent a list of vouchers which corresponds to that structure.
