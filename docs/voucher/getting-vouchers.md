The first step is to acquire the vouchers. This is a manual process where the game studio and the G-Loot compliance team must make sure that the game mechanics, tournament structure, and prize distribution scheme is legal within the realms of competetive gaming.

Once a prize distribution scheme has been agreed upon, the game studio will be sent a list of vouchers that corresponds to that structure. Please note that the number of winners must be pre-defined, a growing prize pool is not supported as of yet.
