Once the vouchers have been delivered, the tournament may begin.
The ways that a tournament could be implemented are manifold. As long as the competition produces a result list sorted on a metric that is determined by skill (i.e. a leaderboard), the game studio has creative freedom within these restrictions. For example, it may be the 100 fastest players to solve a certain solitaire deck or the winners of a more conventional bracket tournament in a chess game.

In the graphical interface of the game, it must be clear that G-Loot legally hosts the competition. The user is required to read and accept the G-Loot terms & conditions before entering the game.
