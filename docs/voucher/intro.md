G-Rewards is a collection of services whose aim is to to enable game developers to use real-money prizes in their products. The integration is very lightweight and non-intrusive and leaves much creative freedom to the game studio. This service is suitable for promotional events and larger tournaments where there is no entry fee.

## What we provide

You handle the tournament; we handle the payouts, compliance and bureaucracy of prize distributions. We provide a voucher-based solution where the winners receive a unique code which can be redeemed on our website for a predefined amount of money. Once the user has redeemed the voucher, they can withdraw the money to their bank account through our payment portal.
