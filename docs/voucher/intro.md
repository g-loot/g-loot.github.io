The voucher prize distribution service is a way for game developers to enable real money prizes in their products. The integration is very light weight and non-intrusive, and leaves much creative freedom to the game studio. This service is suitable for promotional events and larger tournaments where there is no entry fee.

## What we provide

You handle the the tournament; we handle the payouts, compliance and bureaucracy of prize distributions. We provide a voucher-based solution where the winners will be handed a special code that can be redeemed for a pre-defined amount of money on our website. Once the user has redeemed the voucher, they can withdraw the money to their bank account through our payment portal.
