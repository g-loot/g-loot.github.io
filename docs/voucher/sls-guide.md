## 1. Prerequisites

Before using this the api G-Loot needs to do the following:

1. Register your game on our service. For this we might need some display assets from you, such as a logo and url to your website.
2. Add and configure one or more leaderboards for your game to use.
3. Deliver a service account token for our dev and production environments.
